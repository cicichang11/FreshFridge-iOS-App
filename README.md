# FreshFridge-iOS-Mobile-APP
FreshFridge is a mobile app supported by Xcode that helps users to record and track what they have in their fridge to keep an eye on what is about to expire and avoid purchasing redundancies. 

- After registration, each user can login to their account to edit and add their items anytime they want. Users can log out or delete account anytime they want. But the item information will be saved even when the user is logged out. 
- When adding the food to the fridge, users can input the item's name, quantity, and expiration date. Users can also upload pictures associated with the items if they want. 
- Two lists would be showing up-- one for expired items / food and another one for effective items / food.  Information of each item will be presented especially including the number for the amount of days left till expiration. 
- Users can switch languages from English to Chinese.
